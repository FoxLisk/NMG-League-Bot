            <div>Hello! I'm the NMG League Helper Bot, and I would love to create events for you in your own Discord
                server!
            </div>
            <!-- @RequiemOfSpirit: ~when's DDLC~ can you center this for me? ðŸ¥º -->
            <img src="/static/images/helper_bot/headshot.png" style="width:auto; height: 200px;">
            <div>
                To get the events you're interested in, first
                <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1282035853320912909">add me to your
                    server</a>.
                Then you will get access to my <code>/criteria</code> commands.

                <img src="/static/images/helper_bot/criteria_commands.png" style="width:auto; height: 200px;">
            </div>
            <div>
                By default, you'll get no events. Get started by adding a criteria you're interested in, perhaps
                races
                that feature
                yourself:

                <img src="/static/images/helper_bot/criteria_add.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                The other type of criteria besides "player" is "restream," and the two can be combined. For example,
                maybe you want
                races that feature a certain player, but only if there is a restream:
                <img src="/static/images/helper_bot/criteria_add_2.png">
            </div>
            <div>
                You can see your current active criteria with <code>/criteria show</code>:
                <img src="/static/images/helper_bot/criteria_show.png">
            </div>
            <div>d
                And finally, <code>/criteria remove</code> will prompt you with a list of existing criteria and you can
                choose
                which one to remove:
                <img src="/static/images/helper_bot/criteria_remove.png">
            </div>
            <div>

                {{ macros::external_link(href="https://discord.gg/exrgFbna7d", text="ask in the League Discord") }}!
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
